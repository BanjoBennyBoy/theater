[Intro - SKY]
They call you Lady Luck
But there is room for doubt
At times you have a very unladylike way of running out
You're on a date with me
The pickings have been lush
And yet before this evening is over you might give me the brush
You might forget your manners
You might refuse to stay
And so the best that I can do is pray

[Chorus - SKY]
Luck, be a lady tonight
Luck, be a lady tonight
Luck, if you've ever been a lady to begin with
Luck, be a lady tonight
Luck, let a gentleman see
How nice a dame you can be
I've know the way you've treated other guys you've been with
Luck, be a lady with me

[Verse - SKY]
A lady doesn't leave her escort
It isn't fair, it isn't nice
A lady doesn't wander all over the room
And blow on some other guy's dice

[Chorus - SKY]
So let's keep the party polite
Never get out of my sight
Stick with me baby, I'm the fellow you came in with
Luck, be a lady
Luck, be a lady
Luck, be a lady tonight

[Chorus - COMPANY]
Luck be a lady tonight
Luck be a lady tonight
Luck, if you've ever been a lady to begin with
Luck be a lady tonight

[Chorus - SKY]
Luck, let a gentleman see
How nice a dame you can be
I know the way you've treated other guys you've been with
Luck, be a lady with me

[Verse - SKY]
A lady wouldn't flirt with strangers
She'd have a heart, she'd have a soul
A lady wouldn't make little snake eyes at me
When I've bet my life on this roll

[Chorus - SKY]
So let's keep the party polite
Never get out of my sight
Stick with me, baby, I'm the fellow you came in with
Luck, be a lady

[COMPANY]
Luck, be a lady

[SKY]
Luck, be a lady

[COMPANY]
Luck, be a lady

[SKY]
Luck, be a lady tonight	[COMPANY]
Roll, will you roll
What's the matter?
Roll the dice
[COMPANY]
Coming out, coming out, coming out
Right!
