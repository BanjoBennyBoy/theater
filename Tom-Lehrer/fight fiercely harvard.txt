	Fight Fiercely, Harvard

Fight fiercely, Harvard
fight, fight, fight!
Demonstrate to them our skill
Albeit they possess the might
Nonetheless we have the will
How we shall celebrate our victory
We shall invite the whole team up for tea
(How jolly!)
Hurl that spheroid down the field, and
Fight, fight, fight!

Fight fiercely, Harvard
fight, fight, fight!
Impress them with our prowess, do!
Oh, fellows, do not let the crimson down
Be of stout heart and true
Come on, chaps, fight for Harvard's glorious name
Won't it be peachy if we win the game?
(oh, goody!)
Let's try not to injure them, but
Fight, fight, fight!
Let's not be rough though
Fight, fight, fight!
And do fight fiercely!
Fight, fight, fight!
