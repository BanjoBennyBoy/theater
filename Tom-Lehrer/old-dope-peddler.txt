When the shades of night are falling
Comes a fellow ev'ryone knows
It's the old dope peddler
Spreading joy wherever he goes

Ev'ry evening you will find him
Around our neighborhood
It's the old dope peddler
Doing well by doing good

He gives the kids free samples
Because he knows full well
That today's young innocent faces
Will be tomorrow's clientele

Here's a cure for all your troubles
Here's an end to all distress
It's the old dope peddler
With his powdered ha-happiness

   
Forward:

You are no doubt familiar with songs about the old lamplighter, and the old umbrella man, and the old garbage collector, and all these lovable old characters who go around spreading sweetness and light to their respective communities. But it’s always seemed to me that there is one member of this happy band who does an equally splendid job, but who has never been properly recognised In song or story, and this is an attempt to remedy, at least in part, that deplorable situation.
