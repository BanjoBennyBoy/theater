Selling out
Is easy to do –
It's not so hard
To find a buyer for you
When money talks
You're under its spell
Ah, but whaddya have when there's nothing left to sell?

Selling out (I'd rather call it "compromise")
Is easy to do (sometimes you have to close your eyes)
It's not so hard (being rich is no disgrace)
To find a buyer for you (put on your shoes and join the race)
When money talks (it has a very soothing voice)
You're under its spell (it's up to you to make the choice)
Ah, but whaddya have when there's nothing left to sell?
(Before you know it there'll be nothing left to sell)
(Last two lines come simultaneously)

You can't always break the rules
People who try are fools
When you get older, maybe then you will see
I've always found ideals
Don't take the place of meals
And that's how it is and how it will always be

It's so nice to have integrity
I'll tell you why
If you really have integrity
It means your price is very high
So remember when you start to preach and moralize
That we all are in the game, and brother its name is compromise
